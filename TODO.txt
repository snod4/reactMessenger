Fix up how server loads chats once selected from SIDEBAR
  1) Send user and recipient ids and names to database or convoID if old convo. If not
      old, then make new conversation with sender and recipient and send new
      convoID to both sender and recpient -- maybe thru websockets so it can
      happen dynamically like a notification?
